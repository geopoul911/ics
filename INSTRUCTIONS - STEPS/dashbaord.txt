ðŸŽ¯ UX Priorities

At-a-glance clarity: Deadlines, overdue items, and urgent tasks should be highlighted.

Actionability: Consultants should be able to change status, comment, or upload documents without leaving the dashboard.

Role-awareness: A consultant in charge sees broader project-level data, while a regular consultant mainly sees their assigned tasks.
